MAM Logistics Application


Proof of concept logistics application that shows how IOTA's MAM(Masked Authenticated Message) could be used to manage data produced by IoT devices in the logistics industry. There are two componets of the application, the sotfware that runs on the IoT devices and a desktop application to acess and display the information produced.

The desktop application was built using the Electron framework, Materilze CSS and several node.js packages including the MAM client libary ( https://github.com/iotaledger/mam.client.js )
